00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,043
Not very first visit.

28
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,391
You seem to go well.

29
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,978

00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:24,101
I suppose you came because
your brother. And eZi.

31
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,088
Yes.

32
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,839
Ms. Conliffe found that are in London.

33
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,822
- Samson!
- And I sent a letter ...

34
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:34,637
... telling me that Ben has gone.

35
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,263
Father, we offer you my help ...

36
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,822
What great idea.

37
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:41,679
Lawrence is a great idea.

38
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:46,501
Unfortunately your brother's body
was found in a ditch,

39
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,584
next road to the monastery,
yesterday morning.

40
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:52,622
I suppose that's something dressed
the funeral.

41
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,876
Sir John!

42
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,685
Remember you are my son
Lawrence?

43
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,334
Singh, my servant.

44
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,729
Master Lawrence.

45
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:04,021
Good to see you,
Lawrence.

46
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,951
It's good you're here.

47
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,049
Ms. Conliffe was announced?

48
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,759
It's up in the bedroom dance
asleep.

49
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,238
Þin where Ben's body?

50
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:00,864
Father yours told me to bury
things your brother with him.

51
00:06:00,865 --> 00:06:03,537
I was thought it sin.

52
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,093
Thank you.

53
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:09,932
I Do not do it, sir.
It ...

54
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,288
I never saw almost
his entire life.

55
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,643
I do not think it was a beast.

56
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,991
It was a cunning murderers.

57
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:55,434
Someone who shall bear a grudge
one of these people.

58
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,938
To induce authorities in error,
I and Kill shower Manuli,

59
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:01,659
SFA then it displayed the body as to seem
that made it a wild animal.

60
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,703
Ridiculous!
And who would give so much trouble?

61
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:07,165
That dance of the Gypsies Security Bear
could have to do.

62
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,676
Blestemãþia! But I doubt
you can kill three people.

63
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,764
I saw corpses
with my own eyes.

64
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,199
They were hurt are unnatural,

65
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:19,240
are very unnatural.

66
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:21,558
I say that he did
fierce creature.

67
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:25,445
You damn Gypsies who wandered
drãcoveniile bringing this to them!

68
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,211
Q and are appearance and over
two weeks to spend it!

69
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:31,488
I say that Ben Talbot
went to their camp

70
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:34,146
that you-and make the head
þigancã a slut.

71
00:07:34,182 --> 00:07:37,504
The bear put his paw on
and threw what was left of it in the ditch!

72
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:39,424
Had no connection with þiganii.

73
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,411
After 25 years,

74
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,866
Dad found him.

75
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:48,466
NODDY Quinn and all his flock,

76
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,125
dogs and goats and May God knows what,

77
00:07:51,126 --> 00:07:54,068
lepãdaþi throughout MLA and Tina,
on a quarter of mile.

78
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,407
Quinn's is not grateful and tea face.

79
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:00,403
Like he was eaten alive.

80
00:08:00,404 --> 00:08:04,039
Creature who had done
was great ...

81
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,877
have claws
and less and that could not killing.

82
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:10,386
After that,

83
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,101
Dad went home

84
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:16,282
and melt cutlery wedding
mother.

85
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:19,091
He did gloanþe Silver
of them.

86
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:26,476
It no longer exit the house
the full moon was from then on.

87
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,551
I still say that the bear's fault.

88
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,212
We can help, sir?

89
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,840
I hope I can talk
with Miss Conliffe.

90
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,970
One moment, sir.

91
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,069
Miss Conliffe ...

92
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,555
- I am Lawrence.
- I know who you are.

93
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,863
Sorry to meet such.

94
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:28,729
They have belonged to Ben.
And I would like to receive them are you.

95
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,148
If you need anything,
all,

96
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,978
please tell me.

97
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:44,892
I want to know what happened.

98
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:50,491
- I will do everything I will stand putinþã.
- Thank you.

99
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,450
Thank you for coming.

100
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:05,474
Today I saw Ben's body.

101
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,462
What kind of animal
could have done so what?

102
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:11,383
I saw what may be a Panther
or a Bengal tiger,

103
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:13,305
most ferocious beasts of nature

104
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,691
but you gotta admit
that I have never seen so something.

105
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:21,421
People tell city
that a bear did it.

106
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:27,326
A and say that rather
a dangerous lunatic.

107
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,652
If it were possible,
I think I would wild dogs.

108
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:32,833
On the other hand,

109
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:36,048
crime is so awful that the ...

110
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,553
Only a man would be able
also intentional malice.

111
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:44,105
Among the things Ben
I found a strange medallion.

112
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,653
St. Columbanus,
was a saint in the East.

113
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,743
And I was Gypsies.

114
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,452
So Ben had job
with þiganii?

115
00:10:56,479 --> 00:11:01,432
She was ... Our negotiator.

116
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:03,973
Humanity of the place
pay a fee

117
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:07,148
and commit as few þiganii
misdeeds as possible ...

118
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:13,019
and will leave again after
will be sold to young men around here ...

119
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:16,681
as wine and "ladies tuciurii" may lead.

124
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:49,153
I would like things
to be otherwise.

125
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:53,146
It never looked behind, Lawrence.
It never looked behind.

126
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:56,578
Past
is a wild kingdom of horrors.

127
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,270
Lawrence?

128
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,252
I'm glad you're home.

129
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:43,850
Mother!

130
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:49,805
Mother!

00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:05,423
Lawrence <i> ...</ i>

132
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,921
<i> Lawrence. </ i>

133
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,755
Lawrence, wake you up.

134
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,918
I heard something.

135
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,005
Lawrence <i> ...</ i>

136
00:13:33,006 --> 00:13:35,756
Lawrence, I'm afraid.

137
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,415
Go back to bed.

138
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:32,941
Mother?

139
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:36,918
<i> Mother !...</ i>

140
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,145
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,543
Ben said that here you play
when you were young.

142
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,870
It was our refuge.

143
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,804
Compared to what?

144
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,327
You mean "compared to whom".

145
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:46,432
Your father ...
has a Fire Dist.

146
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:52,139
Ben told me it's because
remind you of your mother.

147
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:56,039
I told you and you do it.

148
00:15:56,778 --> 00:16:00,381
Therefore I closed in a hospice
a full year.

149
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:04,384
Then I sent in my rectum and
America.

150
00:16:07,454 --> 00:16:09,895
Sure do not want to stay
evening?

151
00:16:09,931 --> 00:16:12,307
My dad found a hostel.

152
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,263
It's easier
trains.

153
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,496
- When you return to London?
- When you find out what my brother pãþit.

154
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:39,891
All good and beautiful, but I
you better have to wait until tomorrow.

155
00:16:39,892 --> 00:16:41,844
Tonight's full moon and I. ..

156
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:45,309
to and prefer to stay in the house,

157
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:49,449
the idea that your theory, the "lunaticului"
will prove correct.

158
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:52,323
I am not going
You lose and you.

159
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,029
Can I take your horse
cona and rad?

160
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,784
Good evening.

161
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,578
Say you have to stay in camp,
forest is dangerous.

162
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:36,649
Ask him if he knows someone
so selling something.

163
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,522
- Want to talk to your Malev.
- Who?

164
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:40,870
Malev.

165
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,136
It was found on
My brother's body.

166
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:54,577
There was your caravan ...
three people were killed and I.

167
00:17:55,818 --> 00:17:57,596
I do not think that is a coincidence.

168
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,629
It is no coincidence.

169
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,820
It's fate hand,
but she played with books on the table.

170
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:08,025
And you my story about my brother.

171
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,488
Come!

172
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,997
Give us the bear, dresorule!

173
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:49,582
- We know what happens.
- Dance. Just dancing.

174
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,821
Come on!
What's happening?

175
00:18:51,822 --> 00:18:54,302
I came across a large animal.
We killed people.

176
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:57,313
- For God.
- It's harmless.

177
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,590
- What happened?
- Is the devil! Devil!

178
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:02,103
Mother! Mother!

179
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:06,318
Maria! Where are you, Mary?

180
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:08,347
Maria!

181
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,896
Maria ...

182
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:14,822
- There!
- Maria!

183
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,367
Maria!

184
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,464
Mother!

185
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:32,880
Stay in the tent!

186
00:21:01,814 --> 00:21:04,034
Boys ...

187
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,070
Boy!

188
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,849
Bring help!

189
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,978
Once that is how muscle beast
there is no cure.

190
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:25,115
We should leave him to die.

191
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:27,095
That would be a sinful.

192
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,569
There is no sin
if you kill a beast.

193
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,326
Is not it?

194
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:37,024
If you kill a man ...

195
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,323
are not well received
the hereafter.

196
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,583
Many suffered
that.

197
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:45,855
Sometimes, human fate is cruel.

198
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:49,415
May be issued
just someone who loves him.

199
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,712
Lady!

200
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,804
Help me it car, Singh.

201
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:23,774
A week ago I would say
not that you will never use your arm.

202
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:24,751
And now?

203
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:27,203
Seems to have healed.

204
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,531
I will come to consult you
at the end of the week.

205
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:34,151
Thank you, Doctor.

206
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:36,550
- Miss Conliffe?
- Yes.

207
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:39,366
- I want to thank.
- What?

208
00:24:39,398 --> 00:24:41,761
Because you have extended
Blackmoor sitting in with us,

209
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:43,762
during this difficult period.

210
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:47,122
For you did it from a sense of ...
obedience branch

211
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:50,582
would be no trouble for me.

212
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:54,168
Lawrence tried to find out
what happened to Ben.

213
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,789
Now we know ...
beast is still at large.

214
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:03,266
- However, thank.
- Do not you what.

215
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,885
You should sleep, Lawrence.

216
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,732
And you.

217
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:57,709
I serve you?

218
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,246
You'd expect to burst
any war?

219
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,407
Singh is a warrior of God,

220
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,911
need to always equip
against evil.

221
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,890
Do you believe in curses?

222
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,847
This house was part
enough suffering.

223
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:20,730
Your mother, your brother ...
Yes, I believe in curses.

224
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:23,385
But he stayed here so many years ...

225
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:26,009
It was bound to do.

226
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,533
Silver.

227
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:41,248
- I knew not hunt mon ones.
- Sometimes you mon masters and hunt you.

228
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:16,003
It was pretty badly injured, Inspector.

229
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:20,179
Suffer from memory loss,
I do not think it will be of any help.

230
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:23,135
I think at some point
will want to talk about ...

231
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:26,629
I see. And if I could
to exchange a few words ...

232
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,799
- ... Completely unofficial ...
- No, no.

233
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,338
Up and the shortest meeting
sure I would be very helpful.

234
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:41,131
Francis Adderly,
Scotland Yard.

235
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:45,038
It's an honor to meet you, Mr Talbot.
I am a great admirer.

236
00:27:45,287 --> 00:27:47,166
I'm sorry to hear
troubles suffered

237
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,430
I hope you will not prevent
return to the scene.

238
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:51,853
Thank you.

239
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,893
- Let go?
- Please.

240
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:08,568
We understand that your wound
was quite ... wild.

241
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,409
Yes.

242
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,899
I hope you not to seem inquisitive,

243
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,700
but I could arrange
consider you a specialist?

244
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,616
It's amazing what we derive from
means scientific, today.

245
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:26,951
- When you want your course.
- Sure.

246
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:33,122
It's a mystery in view that the
England no natural predators there

247
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:37,805
able to produce
hurt so terrible.

248
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:41,939
Ferocity of the attack would suggest
action of an animal,

249
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:45,544
or ... lunatic.

250
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:49,942
Someone with serious problems
mental health,

251
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:52,111
who spent some time
in a hospice ...

252
00:28:52,146 --> 00:28:57,146
who may have suffered hurt
produced by hand of his victims.

253
00:28:57,147 --> 00:29:01,859
Understand what insinuaþi
and bothers me.

254
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:05,770
It is clear
that I know the past,

255
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,400
so how and I think
I know that the your

256
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,360
If somehow you have investigated
"Ripper" several years ago?

257
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:17,435
Are you a man directly,
So I have and I live with you

258
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:19,927
You are not the enemy, Mr Talbot.

259
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:25,941
But seeing you play so many roles
the same chip,

260
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:30,907
be prudent to ask who does
May "vieþuie and you" in your head

261
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:35,163
Good day, Inspector.

262
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:45,578
So you do not mind if I
say where you were last night.

263
00:29:45,579 --> 00:29:47,549
How you want.

264
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,632
Welcome, Mr Talbot.

265
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:55,954
I will send you Specialists
consult when you want your.

266
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,809
Lawrence?

267
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:28,296
You're okay?
What he told the inspector?

268
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:31,643
He asked many questions.

269
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:36,024
I'm sorry. I feel so
responsible for what you pãþit ...

270
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:40,308
I would of never sent that letter
you have returned to New York.

271
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,591
No. Inhere to go back.

272
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,688
You should not feel the and a.

273
00:30:56,476 --> 00:30:57,443
No.

274
00:30:57,444 --> 00:30:59,256
Tries.

275
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:03,519
I can not make a jump,
like you.

276
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:10,025
We have to throw it off.

277
00:31:12,225 --> 00:31:14,256
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

278
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:21,312
Never mind.
A îndrepþi up ...

279
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:28,581
Tries.

280
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,224
How is New York?

281
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,097
- Hear that?
- What?

282
00:32:03,015 --> 00:32:04,642
Horses.

283
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:19,708
Hello, Doctor.
Park established consultation for Friday.

284
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:20,756
Come with us!

285
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:21,861
Approaching full-moon night.

286
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:25,284
You were muscle how beast.
Now wearing his sign.

287
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,209
This could be the solution.

288
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,970
Many of us were interested
the explanation of "natural".

289
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:33,627
Help us.

290
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:36,694
Come on, Talbot,
show us your wounds.

291
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:39,188
They say that they heal
are unnatural ways.

292
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,400
It can not let you kill
wives and children.

293
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:54,078
- Fuck, Talbot!
- I'm sorry, Colonel.

294
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,197
I wanted to shoot you.

295
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:59,505
Unfortunately, no longer a target and
as good as the old days.

296
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:01,666
- Probably older.
- It's cursed.

297
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,576
God was denied him.

298
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,274
Let us solve.

299
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,830
You enter and take my mo
and I could shoot you and that place right now.

300
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,085
My servant, Singh is on the roof

301
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:13,848
and happens to be a target and
great gun fire repeatedly.

302
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,675
And you will kill.

303
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:19,182
It will kill at least ten of you
By the reload and move less.

304
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,407
So please delete one
of my property.

305
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:24,565
And if you never see on any
entering without permission here

306
00:33:24,566 --> 00:33:27,662
I will not be so civilized.
If pricepeþi what I mean.

307
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:29,784
Good day and to you, Colonel.

308
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,412
Lawrence ...

309
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,649
Bleeding.

310
00:33:54,338 --> 00:33:56,831
How do you think of
it's a threat to them?

311
00:33:57,889 --> 00:34:01,632
Is a stranger here in Blackmoor,
Miss Conliffe,

312
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:04,693
and therefore it is very dangerous.

313
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:07,697
Thank you.

314
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:10,070
Yes, they can thank
Singh and his ...

315
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:13,167
when he returns from the village.

316
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,412
There are single family
equipped to acting.

317
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:21,215
Samson!

318
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,216
To bring something to your wash.

319
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,252
You hit the shoulder?

320
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,898
No.

321
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:46,718
On the contrary, is stronger
than before.

322
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,576
That's good.

323
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:53,996
I could and þin
on all three remote.

324
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,483
You know you should not hear them.

325
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:07,178
Villagers are înapoiaþi and pro are.

326
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:10,865
All you hate the most
in place.

327
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:40,120
Lawrence ...

328
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:51,546
Excuse me.

329
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,090
- What happened?
- I gotta go.

330
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,821
Please do your luggage.

331
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:41,014
I did something?

332
00:36:41,015 --> 00:36:43,517
There are safe here.

333
00:36:43,518 --> 00:36:46,221
You have to go to London
this evening.

334
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:49,009
I expect out.

335
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:52,127
Lawrence!
Wait.

336
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,238
What do you fear?

337
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:07,627
If you pãþi something
I did not and never forget it.

338
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:49,773
Some doubt
the power of Satan.

339
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:55,701
Satan's power to transform
men in irons.

340
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:59,534
But no doubt the ancient pagans.

341
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,891
No prophets.

342
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:03,548
Daniel warned him not to Nebuchadnezzar?

343
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,117
But orgoliosul King
did not listened to Daniel,

344
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:13,032
and as the Bible tells us that he was
converted into a wolf and exiled people.

345
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,637
The Beast has come between us.

346
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:19,227
But Lord
and i will defend believers.

347
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:23,300
With his right hand,
will crush the demon apples and av.

348
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:27,281
I say, the enemy plan
is one and iret.

349
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:30,108
Turning them on the blestemaþi
in irons

350
00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:33,557
wants to throw us into hell,
to transform us into animals.

351
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:36,451
Try to convince us,

352
00:38:36,451 --> 00:38:40,301
that we forget that fãcuþi
the image of the Almighty himself i.

353
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:41,933
Samson.

354
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:47,004
Why tolerate our Lord
this mockery?

355
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:53,321
Pride only open path of destruction.

356
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:56,102
Spirit semeþ before fall ...

357
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:59,540
I say that is happening
because we have sinned in front of His

358
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:01,886
because of our iniquities
were echoed in Heaven

359
00:39:01,887 --> 00:39:04,308
and demand revenge.

360
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:33,498
A bitter, please.

361
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:40,536
- Madam Kirk?
- Why are not out, with McQuinn ...

362
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:44,129
... until you catch that creature
who killed my husband?

363
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:47,731
Since I do not know
they will attack lunaticul,

364
00:39:47,732 --> 00:39:52,566
seems almost to stand as
close to potential victims.

365
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:57,038
And seeing that some 214 of
the most important 300

366
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:00,577
inhabitants of Blackmoor
living within a radius of 500 meters

367
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,054
of this Tavern,

368
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:05,448
I'm going to spend the evening here.

369
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,412
Not at Talbot Hall?

370
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,329
Why did you say that?

371
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,956
I blestemaþi. All of us.

372
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:15,826
Unfortunately, being
"blestemaþi" I do not give permission

373
00:40:15,827 --> 00:40:19,607
mo to walk at night and take Sir John.

374
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,947
Rules, Mrs Kirk ...

375
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:28,034
are designed to protect us
a world in which we SFA and IEM between us.

376
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:33,214
A bitter, please.

377
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:10,672
It is a shrine dedicated
your beloved mother.

378
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:13,151
A truly beautiful woman.

379
00:43:15,284 --> 00:43:19,987
I know her loss
Did he hurt deeply.

380
00:43:20,023 --> 00:43:24,113
It is monstrous that a Baietel
you-and seeing my mother that way.

381
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:29,836
And I would sacrifice my life
let us find you are that night.

382
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:32,231
You gotta believe me, Lawrence.

383
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:33,495
I think, do you?

384
00:43:33,497 --> 00:43:37,896
I loved your mother with a passion
that burned like the sun.

385
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,799
Her death broke me,
I was devastated.

386
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:47,183
I still walk the night the house ...
looking for her.

387
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:51,143
But the dead remain.

388
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,905
Look me in the eye, Lawrence.

389
00:43:56,128 --> 00:44:00,575
You see that are ...
devoid of life.

390
00:44:05,669 --> 00:44:10,936
I would like to say that your tragedy
which has overshadowed your life ended.

391
00:44:10,972 --> 00:44:12,700
But I'm afraid ...

392
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:17,453
that you wait
gloomy watch Hell.

393
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:23,592
I do not think you will kill Lawrence.

394
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:25,606
But you will învinovãþi.

395
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:29,488
Beast will dezlãnþui.

396
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:32,732
Beast will exit the surface.

397
00:46:12,098 --> 00:46:14,208
I got it, folks!
I got him!

398
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:16,698
Find a hole, Johnny!

399
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:31,054
Johnny!

400
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:43,505
McQuinn! 

401
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,330
Lawrence!

402
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,647
Lawrence!

403
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:47,019
Wake you up.

404
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:50,603
Lawrence ...

405
00:49:01,431 --> 00:49:03,602
You did some terrible things,
Lawrence.

406
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:07,665
You did some terrible things.

407
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,992
Do not pull!

408
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,170
On your knees!

409
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:40,954
It's so like you said, inspector.

410
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:43,122
It's like you said.

411
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:44,819
I'm sorry, Sir John.

412
00:49:48,682 --> 00:49:50,280
Be strong, Lawrence.

413
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:53,679
Be strong.

414
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:58,747
Madhouse Lambeth, London

415
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:02,268
Where is my father?

416
00:50:05,322 --> 00:50:09,867
I'm sorry to see you again
here, Lawrence.

417
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:14,164
Disappoint me are.

418
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:21,924
But I did great steps in treatment
illusions and the suffering you.

419
00:50:21,926 --> 00:50:24,195
Where is dad?

420
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:02,934
Refreshing,
not so, buddy?

421
00:51:07,657 --> 00:51:09,045
Where's Dad?

422
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:11,171
Where's Dad? ...

423
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:13,055
Where's Dad?

424
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:29,194
If you do not kill my father,
He comes to kill you.

425
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,541
<i> Horatio, tell me one thing. </ i>

426
00:51:35,543 --> 00:51:38,050
You really <i> Alexander
look the same in the earth? </ i>

427
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,580
<i> And everything smelled so?
(Shakespeare, "Hamlet", tr. Ion Vinea) </ i>

428
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,205
I hope that it will not prevent
you turn on the stage.

429
00:51:43,206 --> 00:51:45,356
<i> Alas, poor Yorick! </ i>

430
00:51:45,356 --> 00:51:47,837
Lawrence, wake you up.

431
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:49,099
I heard something.

432
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:56,684
Terrible things, Lawrence ...
Terrible things.

433
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:00,670
Father!

434
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:08,940
Look me in the eye, Lawrence.

435
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:11,170
You see
you are dead.

436
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:16,227
Nothing, Lawrence.
All is well.

437
00:52:16,227 --> 00:52:19,970
I will go home.
Come with me.

438
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:23,060
Never mind. Come.

439
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:26,906
Never mind.

440
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,664
Keep me in his arms.

441
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,221
Just keep me in his arms.

442
00:52:40,382 --> 00:52:42,056
Not real.

443
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:46,115
Not real.

444
00:52:55,475 --> 00:53:00,718
Licantropie. Licantropie ...

445
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:08,563
I got the disease, if it is,
in India, the Hindu Kuh.

446
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:12,408
Locals took me in on a cave
the mountains,

447
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:16,902
where, according to legend, lived
a strange creature ... very strange.

448
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:21,196
And after several days of cãþãrãri ...

449
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:22,731
and searches ...

450
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:26,011
Finally I came across it.
I found it.

451
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:28,285
I found the cave ...

452
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:32,235
and the strange creature
who live there.

453
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:38,359
It was a Baietel ...
a baby wild,

454
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:40,482
unnaturally loud.

455
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:49,493
Suddenly, I attacked.
He muscle cat.

456
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:55,528
So I returned
to my comrades hunting them

457
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:56,706
location in the valley at the foot of the mountain

458
00:53:56,742 --> 00:53:58,828
believing that I had been the subject of jokes.

459
00:54:00,626 --> 00:54:02,824
But soon I discovered
and that was not the a.

460
00:54:10,924 --> 00:54:13,854
You killed my mother.

461
00:54:15,915 --> 00:54:17,863
Yes, Lawrence,
I did.

462
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,768
It should
put an end to your life.

463
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:25,728
No you can not say
whenever I thought about it,

464
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,769
but life is too splendid, Lawrence,

465
00:54:27,868 --> 00:54:31,913
especially for those blestemaþi
and condemned, like me.

466
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:40,534
The full moon nights, years in the string,
I was locked in that vault

467
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:46,565
of my faithful servant,
Singh. 25.

468
00:54:48,646 --> 00:54:52,587
Then came her
hot and moon face.

469
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,935
Gwen.

470
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:15,445
... Occurred as illusions
of an appalling nature.

471
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:21,239
Mr. Talbot.

472
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,157
This evening we are here
to demonstrate decisively

473
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:28,619
fears that Mr Talbot is iraþionale.

474
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:29,560
A So ...

475
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:32,786
we remain in this room together

476
00:55:32,822 --> 00:55:39,707
and the patient will find that months
full has no influence on him

477
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,345
that it is an absolutely ordinary man,

478
00:55:44,379 --> 00:55:52,335
will be the first small step towards the long
to însãnãto and mental improvement.

479
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,976
And we all know that Mr Talbot
suffered

480
00:55:55,977 --> 00:56:00,341
Personal experiences
trauma.

481
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:04,953
He witnessed the self-harm
his mother,

482
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:08,236
and minds of young,
unable to accept reality,

483
00:56:08,271 --> 00:56:11,050
created a "really" fantastic.

484
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,555
That his father is to blame.

485
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:20,771
That his father is, literally,
a monster.

486
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:23,836
But ...

487
00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:28,311
Your father is a werewolf.

488
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:31,851
You were muscle as a werewolf.

489
00:56:31,884 --> 00:56:35,238
You will become a werewolf ...

490
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:40,231
I do not like a dog will grow wings
and I will not fly on that window.

491
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,858
I think Mr Talbot
has something to tell us.

492
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:03,828
Încetaþi ... Încetaþi ...

493
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:08,161
Here, Mr Talbot?
Forgive me, but you can hear.

494
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:11,788
Idiot!

495
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:15,640
Tonight
I will kill you all!

496
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:19,158
I'll kill everyone!

497
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:24,179
As you see,
I can not ...

498
00:57:24,181 --> 00:57:26,090
Please, do something!

499
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:34,166
... of mind, with somewhere
in the depths ...

500
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:38,851
For him, everything seems very real.

501
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:11,816
Doctor Hoenneger!

502
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:22,999
Doctor!

503
00:59:06,771 --> 00:59:08,621
Open the door to that!

504
00:59:08,623 --> 00:59:10,226
It seems to be locked, sir.

505
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:27,273
Open the door to that!

506
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:25,548
- Gibbons!
- Yes, sir.

507
01:00:25,549 --> 01:00:27,224
- You're armed?
- Yes, sir.

508
01:00:27,225 --> 01:00:28,845
Give me a revolver. Quick!

509
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:00,842
Move! Move!

510
01:01:00,843 --> 01:01:02,134
I'm sorry.

511
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:16,786
- Carter!
- Sir?

512
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:18,170
- You gun?
- Yes, sir.

513
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:19,301
Follow me.

514
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:21,311
Send a telegram to Scotland Yard.
To bring guns!

515
01:01:21,312 --> 01:01:23,253
- Now!
- I'm going, sir!

516
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:30,685
- Suppose that we gloanþe silver.
- What?

517
01:02:14,493 --> 01:02:15,656
You two, come with me!

518
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,424
Doors URELIT ...

519
01:02:49,759 --> 01:02:51,528
God help us!

520
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,926
Who's there?

521
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:54,017
Lawrence!

522
01:04:54,998 --> 01:04:56,456
What Looking here?

523
01:05:01,336 --> 01:05:03,211
What you have done?

524
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:07,669
They are what they say.

525
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:10,316
I am a monster.

526
01:05:12,444 --> 01:05:14,424
Like my father.

527
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,698
He killed Ben.

528
01:05:20,948 --> 01:05:22,547
And mother.

529
01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:43,859
I can help.

530
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,376
Can not be helped.

531
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,038
If such things exist ...

532
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,174
are possible if ...

533
01:05:55,175 --> 01:06:00,033
where everything is ...

535
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:09,276
Can find a way to put an end.

536
01:06:14,422 --> 01:06:16,362
You have to confess ...

537
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:20,857

Have to ask directly.
You have seen on Lawrence Talbot?

551
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:06,187

about his escape.

Yes, I heard
and no, I've seen.
